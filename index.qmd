# üëã Hi there!

I am an experienced research leader with a PhD in Human Development and a track record of building research operations from the ground up. I lead a bilingual, remote-first team at [Hello Insight](https://helloinsight.org), a B2B SaaS company, that turns messy data into clear insights.

## üìÅ Public Projects

- [Core Ideas](https://github.com/dcatalanmolina/Core-Ideas): A free, introductory course to R. I created this course to help labmates in grad school and then I improved it to help others who were struggling to get started in R. Along the code, I wrote a series of Substack posts in English and Spanish (with videos) to help people learn.

- [Compa√±ero](https://companero.substack.com): I had so much fun building Core Ideas that I kept writing on workflow and communication. For example, I wrote a step-by-step series on how to create [paged HTML documents in R](https://companero.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-paged-html-document). 

- [RCTID](https://github.com/dcatalanmolina/rctid): Just for fun, I'm building a workflow to predict Major League Soccer match results. I'm a fan of the Portland Timbers (my local football team) and I've always been curious about sports predictive analytics.
