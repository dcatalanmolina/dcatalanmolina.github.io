I lead a bilingual, remote-first team at Hello Insight, a B2B SaaS company, that turns messy data into clear insights.\n\n\n\nCore Ideas: A free, introductory course to R. I created this course to help labmates in grad school and then I improved it to help others who were struggling to get started in R. Along the code, I wrote a series of Substack posts in English and Spanish (with videos) to help people learn.\nCompañero: I had so much fun building Core Ideas that I kept writing on workflow and communication. For example, I wrote a step-by-step series on how to create paged HTML documents in R.\nRCTID: Just for fun, I’m building a workflow to predict Major League Soccer match results. I’m a fan of the Portland Timbers (my local football team) and I’ve always been curious about sports predictive analytics."
